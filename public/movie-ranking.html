<h1>The Best Movies According to Kayla</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies Of All Time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. The Grinch</h3>
<p>One of my favourite Christmas Movies is the Grinch, specifically Jim Carrey's verion. It's not Christmas until I've watched this movie!</p>
<h3>2. Secondhand Lions</h3>
<p>This is such a heartwarming movie to me. I love the storyline of the uncle's time overseas, but my favourite part has to be Walter's relationship with Jasmine the lion.</p>
<h3>3. The Office</h3>
<p>I understand the Office is a show, not a movie. However, the humor in this show deserves appreciation in my list because it's remained a go-to in my life on a daily basis.</p>
